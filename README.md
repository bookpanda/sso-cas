# SSO: Central Authentication Service

## What is SSO
Single Sign-On (SSO) is a user authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials. This is a common practice in the enterprise, where a user can log in to their computer and, with a single login, gain access to all of the applications they need to do their job.

This project is a very simple implementation of SSO.
